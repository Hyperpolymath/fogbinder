**Fogbinder** is a Zotero plugin designed for those who seek nuance in their research. It illuminates contradiction, emotional tone, and unresolved ambiguity within citations—making murk not something to fear, but something to follow.

'''

== Features

=== Contradiction Detection

Identify when ideas across sources clash, inviting richer analysis and thematic depth.

=== Mood Scoring

Annotate and filter sources based on emotional tone—melancholy, ecstatic, anxious, etc.

=== Mystery Clustering

Surface and tag speculative or ambiguous references that spark curiosity.

=== FogTrail Visualization

A network map of epistemic opacity showing how your research clouds, contradicts, and clears.

'''

== Accessibility

Fogbinder follows inclusive design principles:

* Semantic HTML with proper `aria-label` and role attributes
* Keyboard navigation and focus indicators
* High-contrast UI elements
* Localization support for multilingual use

[quote]
_Ambiguity should never mean inaccessibility._

'''

== Security

Your privacy matters. Fogbinder:

* Sanitizes input to prevent injection
* Never stores API keys or external data
* Includes strict `.gitignore` and no tracking scripts
* Follows open-source transparency principles
* Uses post-quantum cryptography (Ed448, Kyber-1024, SHAKE256)
* Git operations via SSH only
* TLS 1.3 with strong ciphers

For detailed security information, see link:SECURITY.md[SECURITY.md].

'''

== Architecture

Fogbinder uses a **ReScript + WASM** architecture:

* **ReScript** - 100% type-safe functional programming language
* **WASM modules** - Performance-critical operations in Rust
* **Deno runtime** - JavaScript/WASM execution (no Node.js)
* **NO TypeScript** - Eliminated completely
* **NO npm** - No Node.js dependencies

See link:ARCHITECTURE_RESCRIPT_WASM.adoc[ARCHITECTURE_RESCRIPT_WASM.adoc] for details.

'''

'''

== Usage

=== Basic workflow

1. **Install Fogbinder** in Zotero
2. **Select sources** in your library
3. **Run analysis** via Fogbinder menu
4. **Explore results**:
   - Contradictions highlighted
   - Mood scores displayed
   - Mystery clusters shown
   - FogTrail visualization

=== Advanced features

* **Custom mood categories** - Define your own emotional taxonomy
* **Contradiction severity** - Adjust detection sensitivity
* **Export FogTrail** - SVG, JSON, or interactive HTML
* **Batch processing** - Analyze entire collections

'''

== Philosophy

Fogbinder embraces **epistemic humility** and **ordinary language philosophy**:

* **Ambiguity is a feature** - Not a bug to be fixed
* **Contradictions invite analysis** - Not errors to be eliminated
* **Emotional tone matters** - Research is human
* **Accessibility is fundamental** - Software for all
* **Privacy is a right** - No surveillance, no tracking

See link:PHILOSOPHY.adoc[PHILOSOPHY.adoc] for philosophical foundations.

'''

== License

Fogbinder is **dual-licensed** - you choose:

=== Option 1: MIT License

Permissive license for maximum freedom.

=== Option 2: GNU AGPL-3.0

Network copyleft ensuring software freedom.

=== Palimpsest License (Philosophical Overlay)

Both licenses include the **Palimpsest License** as a philosophical commitment to:
