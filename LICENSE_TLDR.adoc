= License TL;DR – Fogbinder
:toc: left
:icons: font

== Dual Licensing

Fogbinder is **dual-licensed** - you choose which license applies to your use:

* **MIT License** (permissive)
* **GNU AGPL-3.0** (network copyleft)

Both include the **Palimpsest License** as a philosophical overlay.

'''

== Option 1: MIT License

=== What you can do

* **Use** - Commercial or non-commercial
* **Modify** - Change anything
* **Distribute** - Share freely
* **Sublicense** - Relicense derivatives
* **Keep private** - No obligation to share modifications

=== What you must do

* **Include copyright notice** - Preserve attribution
* **Include license text** - Include MIT license with distributions

=== What you get

* **No warranty** - Software "as-is"
* **Limitation of liability** - No legal claims against authors

=== Summary

Maximum freedom, minimal obligations. Perfect for:

* Proprietary products
* Closed-source modifications
* Integration into non-free software

'''

== Option 2: GNU AGPL-3.0

=== Network Freedom

If someone uses Fogbinder on a server (e.g. a hosted Zotero service), they **must give users access to the source code**—even if they just interact with it remotely.

=== Copyleft

Any modifications, forks, or derivative versions **must also be shared under the AGPL-3.0**, protecting community freedom.

=== Open Access

You can use, modify, and share Fogbinder freely, including in commercial settings—but you **must share your changes** if you distribute or host them.

=== Legal Safety Net

You're protected from liability ("as-is" clause), and contributors agree not to sue others over patents tied to Fogbinder.

=== License Must Travel

Any project that builds on Fogbinder carries the AGPL-3.0 license forward—like storytelling stitched from the same ethical fabric.

=== Summary

Ensures software freedom. Perfect for:

* Open-source projects
* Community-driven development
* Network services (web apps, APIs)
* Preventing proprietary capture

'''

== Palimpsest License (Philosophical Overlay)

Both MIT and AGPL include the **Palimpsest License** as a commitment to:

=== 1. Epistemic Humility

Knowledge is provisional. Code, like thought, is always under revision.

=== 2. Ordinary Language

Meaning emerges from use. Documentation matters as much as implementation.

=== 3. Code as Palimpsest

Software is written in layers. Each contribution adds to, but doesn't erase, what came before.

=== 4. Embrace Contradiction

Multiple truths can coexist. Contradictions invite deeper understanding.

=== 5. Open Inquiry

Question assumptions. Challenge conventional wisdom. Seek nuance.

=== 6. Accessibility

Software should be usable by all, regardless of ability.

=== 7. Privacy & Autonomy

No surveillance. No tracking. Users control their data.

=== 8. Community Over Profit

Software serves people, not shareholders.

'''

== How to Choose

=== Choose MIT if:

* You want maximum flexibility
* You may create proprietary derivatives
* You don't want copyleft obligations
* You're integrating into closed-source software

=== Choose AGPL-3.0 if:

* You want to ensure software freedom
* You're building network services
* You want derivatives to remain open-source
* You value community contributions
* You want to prevent proprietary capture

=== Both are equally valid

There is **no preferred license**. Choose what aligns with your values and use case.

'''

== Legal Compliance

=== If you choose MIT:

1. Include copyright notice in all copies
2. Include full MIT license text
3. No other obligations

=== If you choose AGPL-3.0:

1. Include copyright notice in all copies
2. Include full AGPL-3.0 license text
3. Provide source code to all network users
4. License derivatives under AGPL-3.0
5. Document all modifications
6. Preserve author attributions

== Frequently Asked Questions

=== Can I use both licenses simultaneously?

No. You **choose one** for your use. The dual licensing means different users can make different choices.

=== Can I switch licenses later?

You can switch **to AGPL-3.0** (more restrictive), but not **to MIT** (less restrictive) once you've distributed under AGPL-3.0.

=== What about dependencies?

Fogbinder has **no Node.js/npm dependencies**. ReScript and Rust dependencies are MIT or Apache-2.0 compatible with both licenses.

=== Does the Palimpsest License add legal obligations?

No. It's a **philosophical overlay**, not a legal requirement. It expresses values but doesn't create enforceable obligations beyond MIT or AGPL-3.0.

=== What about contributions?

Contributors grant rights under **both** MIT and AGPL-3.0 via the Contributor License Agreement (CLA).
