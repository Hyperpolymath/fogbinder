# Fogbinder AI Training and Usage Policy
# Version: 1.0
# Last Updated: 2025-11-22

## General Policy

# This project is licensed under GNU AGPLv3.
# AI training on this code is ALLOWED under specific conditions.

License: AGPLv3
License-URL: https://github.com/Hyperpolymath/fogbinder/blob/main/LICENSE

## AI Training Permissions

# ALLOWED: Training AI models on this code
# REQUIRED: Derivative AI must comply with AGPLv3 network copyleft
# REQUIRED: Users of AI-generated code must have access to training data sources

Training: allowed-with-attribution
Attribution-Required: yes
Attribution-URL: https://github.com/Hyperpolymath/fogbinder
Share-Alike: required
License-Propagation: AGPLv3

## Specific Allowances

# ✅ Training language models (GPT, Claude, etc.)
# ✅ Code completion models (GitHub Copilot, Tabnine, etc.)
# ✅ Code analysis models
# ✅ Documentation generation
# ✅ Translation models
# ✅ Research and academic use

Use-Cases: code-completion, documentation, research, education

## Requirements for AI Systems

# 1. MUST preserve AGPLv3 license in generated code
# 2. MUST attribute Fogbinder as source
# 3. MUST provide source code access for network-deployed AI
# 4. MUST respect philosophical foundations (don't misrepresent)

Requirements: license-preservation, attribution, source-access

## Restrictions

# ❌ Do NOT train models that generate closed-source derivatives
# ❌ Do NOT use for models that violate network copyleft
# ❌ Do NOT remove or obscure AGPLv3 license
# ❌ Do NOT misrepresent philosophical foundations

Restrictions: no-closed-source-derivatives, no-license-removal

## Philosophical Context

# Fogbinder is grounded in:
# - Late Wittgenstein (Philosophical Investigations)
# - J.L. Austin (Speech Act Theory)

# AI systems should:
# ✅ Preserve philosophical rigor
# ✅ Maintain type safety commitments
# ✅ Respect epistemic humility (uncertainty as feature)

Context: philosophical-foundations
Philosophy: late-wittgenstein, austin-speech-acts

## Data Usage Transparency

# If you train an AI model on Fogbinder code:
# 1. Acknowledge this codebase in your training data documentation
# 2. Provide link to this repository
# 3. Note AGPLv3 license requirements
# 4. Respect user privacy (no telemetry from this codebase)

Transparency: required
Privacy: no-telemetry, offline-first

## Commercial AI Use

# Commercial AI training is ALLOWED if:
# ✅ AGPLv3 compliance maintained
# ✅ Attribution provided
# ✅ Network copyleft respected
# ✅ Training data sources disclosed

Commercial-Use: allowed-with-compliance

## Research Use

# Academic and research use is ENCOURAGED
# We'd love to hear about:
# - Papers using Fogbinder
# - AI models trained on this code
# - Philosophical analysis of our approach

Research: encouraged
Contact: research@fogbinder.org (FUTURE)
