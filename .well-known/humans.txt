/* PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATIONS */

Late Wittgenstein:
- Meaning is use in language games
- Family resemblance (no strict definitions)
- Showing vs saying (ineffability)

J.L. Austin:
- Speech acts do things (performatives)
- Illocutionary force
- Felicity conditions

Commitment:
This is not superficial philosophy - these principles are encoded in the type system and architecture.

/* DESIGN PHILOSOPHY */

Ambiguity as Feature:
Fogbinder treats epistemic uncertainty as a feature, not a bug. We embrace contradiction, mood, and mystery as valuable dimensions of scholarly exploration.

Type-Driven Design:
Types encode philosophical commitments. The ReScript type system prevents entire classes of conceptual errors.

Offline-First:
No external API calls, no tracking, no telemetry. Your research stays private.

Accessibility:
WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. Ambiguity should never mean inaccessibility.

/* SPECIAL THANKS */

This project was built autonomously by Claude (Anthropic) in response to a challenging philosophical + technical brief. The human creativity lies in the conceptual framing and philosophical rigor - the implementation is a testament to AI-assisted development.

Balance: Human philosophy + AI execution = Novel research tools
