|===

=== Known Limitations

* Mock Zotero API (requires production integration)
* 2 remaining JavaScript files pending ReScript conversion
* External security audit not yet performed
* WASM modules not yet compiled

== Phase 1: Foundation Completion (v0.2.0)

=== Code Migration

* [ ] Convert `src/main.js` to ReScript entry point
* [ ] Convert `src/zotero/zotero_api.js` to ReScript bindings
* [ ] Achieve 100% ReScript codebase
* [ ] Update all imports and build configuration

=== WASM Integration

* [ ] Compile Rust WASM modules:
  - `crypto/` - Ed448, Kyber-1024, SHAKE256
  - `contradiction_detector/` - High-performance analysis
  - `string_similarity/` - Fuzzy matching
  - `graph_algorithms/` - Network analysis
* [ ] Integrate WASM with ReScript via bindings
* [ ] Add WASM-specific security sandboxing
* [ ] Performance benchmarks vs pure ReScript

=== Testing Enhancement

* [ ] Increase property-based test coverage to 95%
* [ ] Add integration tests for full analysis pipeline
* [ ] Add regression test suite
* [ ] Implement mutation testing

== Phase 2: Zotero Production Integration (v0.3.0)

=== Zotero Plugin Development

* [ ] Replace mock API with real Zotero bindings
* [ ] Implement read-only Zotero library access
* [ ] Add collection/item selection UI
* [ ] Implement result annotation storage
* [ ] Create Zotero preferences panel

=== UI/UX Development

* [ ] Design FogTrail visualization component
* [ ] Implement contradiction graph viewer
* [ ] Add mood score timeline visualization
* [ ] Create mystery cluster explorer
* [ ] Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance throughout

=== Documentation

* [ ] Write Zotero plugin installation guide
* [ ] Create user manual with screenshots
* [ ] Add API documentation for developers
* [ ] Create video tutorials

== Phase 3: Security Hardening (v0.4.0)

=== External Security Audit

* [ ] Engage security firm (Cure53 or similar)
* [ ] Perform code review audit
* [ ] Address all critical/high findings
* [ ] Document audit results and mitigations

=== Penetration Testing

* [ ] Schedule penetration test
* [ ] Test Zotero integration boundaries
* [ ] Test WASM module isolation
* [ ] Test input sanitization

=== Supply Chain Security

* [ ] Implement SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)
* [ ] Add dependency scanning (Dependabot alerts)
* [ ] Implement SLSA Level 2 attestations
* [ ] Set up Sigstore signing

=== SAST/DAST Implementation

* [ ] Enable CodeQL advanced queries
* [ ] Add Semgrep rules for ReScript patterns
* [ ] Implement runtime security monitoring
* [ ] Add CSP violation reporting

== Phase 4: Performance Optimization (v0.5.0)

=== Profiling & Benchmarking

* [ ] Profile full analysis pipeline
* [ ] Identify performance bottlenecks
* [ ] Benchmark against large citation libraries (1000+ items)
* [ ] Create performance regression tests

=== Optimizations

* [ ] Optimize WASM module loading (lazy loading)
* [ ] Implement result caching
* [ ] Add incremental analysis support
* [ ] Optimize FogTrail graph rendering

=== Memory Management

* [ ] Profile memory usage patterns
* [ ] Implement streaming for large datasets
* [ ] Add memory usage limits
* [ ] Document memory requirements

== Phase 5: Formal Verification (v0.6.0)

=== TLA+ Specifications

* [ ] Complete core algorithm specifications
* [ ] Verify contradiction detection invariants
* [ ] Verify mood scoring consistency
* [ ] Verify graph algorithm correctness

=== Property Testing Expansion

* [ ] Add stateful property tests
* [ ] Implement model checking
* [ ] Add fuzzing for input parsing
* [ ] Document verification coverage

== Phase 6: Ecosystem Integration (v0.7.0)

=== Export Formats

* [ ] Export to Markdown (analysis reports)
* [ ] Export to CSV (tabular data)
* [ ] Export to GraphML (network graphs)
* [ ] Export to BibTeX (annotated citations)

=== Integration APIs

* [ ] REST API for external tools
* [ ] CLI interface for batch processing
* [ ] WebSocket API for real-time analysis
* [ ] Plugin SDK for extensions

=== Localization

* [ ] Implement i18n framework
* [ ] Add translations (es, fr, de, zh)
* [ ] Localize UI and documentation
* [ ] Add RTL language support

== Phase 7: Beta Release (v0.9.0)

=== Beta Testing Program

* [ ] Recruit beta testers from academic community
