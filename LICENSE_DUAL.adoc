```

**When to choose MIT:**
- You want maximum freedom to use, modify, and distribute
- You're building proprietary/commercial software
- You prefer permissive licensing
- You don't want copyleft obligations

---

## Option 2: GNU Affero General Public License v3.0

**Full text:** See [LICENSE_AGPL](./LICENSE) (the original full AGPLv3 text)

**Summary:**
- You must provide source code to users over a network
- Derivative works must also be licensed under AGPLv3
- Network copyleft ensures software freedom
- Strong copyleft provisions

**When to choose AGPL:**
- You're building open-source/free software
- You want to ensure derivatives remain open
- You're running software as a service
- You support software freedom

**Note:** AGPLv3 is the **strongest copyleft license**. If you modify Fogbinder and make it available over a network (e.g., web service), you **must** provide source code to users.

## Palimpsest License (Philosophical Overlay)

**Version 1.0**

### Preamble

A palimpsest is a manuscript page that has been written on, scraped off, and used again. The earlier writing remains visible beneath the new text, creating layers of meaning.

Fogbinder embraces this philosophy: code is not a single truth, but **layers of interpretation, contradiction, and evolving understanding**.

### Philosophical Commitments

By using Fogbinder, you acknowledge and embrace:

#### 1. **Epistemic Humility**
- Knowledge is provisional, not absolute
- Uncertainty is valuable, not a flaw
- Contradictions invite deeper analysis

#### 2. **Ordinary Language**
- Meaning emerges from use, not definition
- Language games shape understanding
- Context matters more than formal logic

#### 3. **Code as Palimpsest**
- Code has layers of meaning
- Comments, commits, and history are part of the text
- Previous versions inform current understanding

#### 4. **Embrace Contradiction**
- Contradictions are not always errors
- Different frameworks can be incommensurable
- Multiple truths can coexist

#### 5. **Open Inquiry**
- Question assumptions
- Follow the argument where it leads
- Prioritize understanding over winning

#### 6. **Accessibility**
- Software should be usable by all
- Screen readers, keyboard navigation, high contrast
- No user left in the fog

#### 7. **Privacy & Autonomy**
- No surveillance, no tracking, no data collection
- Users control their own data
- Offline-first by design

#### 8. **Community Over Profit**
- Software freedom > commercial gain
- Share knowledge freely
- Contribute upstream

### Legal Effect

The Palimpsest License is a **philosophical overlay**. It has **no legal force** beyond the chosen legal license (MIT or AGPL).

It is a **social contract**, not a legal contract.

It expresses the **spirit** of the project, not the **letter** of the law.

### Violations

If someone violates the Palimpsest principles:
- They do not violate the legal license
- They may lose community goodwill
- The project may fork, disassociate, or criticize

**But:** We will not sue, threaten, or harass. We will engage in **rational discourse**.
