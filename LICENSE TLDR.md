🌐 Network Freedom If someone uses Fogbinder on a server (e.g. a hosted Zotero service), they must give users access to the source code—even if they just interact with it remotely.

🔄 Copyleft Any modifications, forks, or derivative versions must also be shared under the AGPLv3, protecting community freedom.

🔓 Open Access You can use, modify, and share Fogbinder freely, including in commercial settings—but you must share your changes if you distribute or host them.

🛡 Legal Safety Net You’re protected from liability ("as-is" clause), and contributors agree not to sue others over patents tied to Fogbinder.

📜 License Must Travel Any project that builds on Fogbinder carries the AGPLv3 license forward—like storytelling stitched from the same ethical fabric.
