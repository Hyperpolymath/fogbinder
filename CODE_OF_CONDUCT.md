# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the Fogbinder community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

### Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

✅ **Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people**
✅ **Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences**
✅ **Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback**
✅ **Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience**
✅ **Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community**
✅ **Using welcoming and inclusive language**
✅ **Being respectful of differing philosophical interpretations** (especially regarding late Wittgenstein and Austin!)

### Examples of unacceptable behavior:

❌ **The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind**
❌ **Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks**
❌ **Public or private harassment**
❌ **Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission**
❌ **Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting**
❌ **Dismissing accessibility concerns or refusing to accommodate reasonable requests**
❌ **Gaslighting or invalidating others' experiences**

## Philosophical Disagreement vs. Harassment

Fogbinder is grounded in specific philosophical commitments (late Wittgenstein, J.L. Austin). Intellectual disagreement is welcome and encouraged, but:

✅ **OK:** "I think your interpretation of family resemblance is incorrect because..."
✅ **OK:** "Have you considered Davidson's truth-conditional semantics as an alternative?"
✅ **OK:** "I disagree with treating ambiguity as a feature rather than a bug."

❌ **NOT OK:** "Your philosophical approach is stupid."
❌ **NOT OK:** "Only an idiot would take Wittgenstein seriously."
❌ **NOT OK:** Dismissing contributions based on philosophical stance rather than technical merit.

**Guiding principle:** Attack ideas, not people. Assume good faith. Steel-man, don't straw-man.

## Emotional Safety

In addition to the standard Code of Conduct, Fogbinder is committed to **emotional safety** in the development process:

### Emotional Temperature Monitoring

We recognize that **software development can be emotionally taxing**. We encourage:

- Taking breaks when frustrated
- Asking for help when stuck
- Acknowledging when you don't know something
- Celebrating small wins
- Being patient with yourself and others

### Reversibility as Safety

We embrace **reversibility** in our workflow:

- ✅ **All changes are reversible** via git
- ✅ **Experiments are encouraged** (we can always revert)
- ✅ **Failure is a learning opportunity** (not a character flaw)
- ✅ **"I was wrong" is a strength** (not a weakness)

### Preventing Burnout

**Red flags we watch for:**
- ⚠️ Working excessive hours
- ⚠️ Skipping breaks
- ⚠️ Declining code quality due to rushing
- ⚠️ Increasing conflict in discussions
- ⚠️ Withdrawal from community participation

**If you notice these in yourself or others, please:**
1. Take a step back
2. Talk to a maintainer (confidentially if needed)
3. Adjust workload or take time off
4. Remember: **This is volunteer work. Your well-being comes first.**

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement:

- **Email:** conduct@fogbinder.org (FUTURE - not yet active)
- **GitHub:** Private message to @Hyperpolymath (Jonathan)
- **Anonymous:** Use GitHub's anonymous reporting (if available)

**All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.**

**We guarantee:**
- Confidentiality will be respected
- Reports will be taken seriously
- No retaliation against reporters
- Transparent outcomes (to the extent possible)

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these **Community Impact Guidelines** in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Appeals

If you believe an enforcement action was taken in error, you may appeal by:

1. Emailing conduct+appeal@fogbinder.org (FUTURE)
2. Contacting a different maintainer than the one who issued the enforcement
3. Providing additional context or clarification

Appeals will be reviewed by maintainers not involved in the original decision.

## FAQ

### Q: What if I witness a Code of Conduct violation?

**A:** Please report it using the methods above. Don't assume someone else will report it. Your report can be anonymous.

### Q: What if I accidentally violate the Code of Conduct?

**A:** If someone points it out, apologize sincerely and learn from it. We all make mistakes. What matters is how we respond.

### Q: Can I disagree with philosophical foundations?

**A:** Yes! Intellectual disagreement is encouraged. Just be respectful in how you express it.

### Q: What if I'm not sure if something violates the CoC?

**A:** When in doubt, ask a maintainer privately. Or err on the side of reporting (false positives are better than unreported violations).

### Q: Is this enforced retroactively?

**A:** No. This CoC applies from the date of adoption forward. However, egregious behavior may be addressed regardless of timing.
